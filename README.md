# Physical-Design-with-OpenLANE-using-Sky130-PDK
This project was completed for the VLSI System Design Corporation's "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" course. This project uses Skywater 130nm PDK and Openlane to run an entire RTL to GDSII sequence for the PicoRV32a SoC. Additionally employed in the flow are standard cells with a custom design and Sky130 PDK. There are timing optimisations made. Violations of slack are eliminated. DRC is confirmed.

# Physical-Design-with-OpenLANE-using-Sky130-PDK
This project was completed for the VLSI System Design Corporation's "Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130" course. This project uses Skywater 130nm PDK and Openlane to run an entire RTL to GDSII sequence for the PicoRV32a SoC. Additionally employed in the flow are standard cells with a custom design and Sky130 PDK. There are timing optimisations made. Violations of slack are eliminated. DRC is confirmed.
# Inside a chip:
The chip is connected to the outside world by pads, and different signals are used to access the chip from there.
The ASIC's digital logic is located at the core.
The Die determines the IC's packaging or skeleton size.
The typical IC would include a SoC, SRAM, PLLs (to double or divide the main clock frequency), ADC and DAC blocks to enable analogue communication with the outside world, as well as a few more blocks. Foundry IPs, or "Foundry intellectual property," are the blocks.

The foundries are where the chips are made, and their research gives us the PDKs that are used to design the ICs. Since the research is expensive and The Foundry IPs are confidential,although there are open source PDKs like Skywater130, which is a 130nm process node, meaning the channel length between the source and drain is 130nm, the PDKs are extremely secret. There are ICs with a 5nm manufacturing node currently available.
Macro, such as the SoC depicted in the diagram, is fully digital logic that is built using a Hardware Description language.

Even for embedded designs, communication with the foundry is crucial because a different process node for a SoC with the same functionality could result in signal integrity problems for a PCB because the rise time for different SoCs manufactured with different process nodes would be different. As a result, the already tested and functional PCB with the SoC manufactured with a 130nm process node would experience these issues.

#Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
The interface between a computer system's hardware and software is defined by a collection of guidelines and specifications called the Instruction collection Architecture (ISA). It establishes how a processor interprets and carries out instructions given by software applications. As long as they follow the instructions and rules specified by the ISA, it enables software developers to design programmes without worrying about the specifics of the underlying hardware.

Humans write a piece of code in a comprehensible language, which is then translated into Assembly code in accordance with an ISA. The assembly code is written in hexadecimal digits, which are then translated into binary numbers or the on/off of transistors laid out in a certain way that can run on the specific ISA for which the layout is intended. The bits enter the layout, and the output is produced.

RISC-V ISA is used as an illustration. An HDL language is used to design the ISA's layout, and an RTL description follows. The RISC-V architecture specifications are implemented in the RTL description, and an IC that can execute human-written code is created by following the RTL to GDSII path.

# Hardware and Software Symbiosis
The system software, which consists of the operating system, compiler, and assembler, is used to read the application software. The application software is transformed into hardware-compatible binary code by the system software.

The OS compiles and translates the application programme into assembly code. Apart from memory allocation, processing IO operations, and low-level system tasks like memory management, process management, user interface, task scheduling, power management, error handling and logging, file system administration, networking, etc., this is the OS's primary job.
Small functions written in one of the languages, such as C, C++, Java, VB, etc., are the outputs of an OS. The assembly language code is then generated by compiling these short routines. The Hardware designed, for example, affects the syntax of the assembly code. Different assembly code syntaxes apply to RISC-V and Intel x86 devices, respectively. This syntax is known as ISA. The machine language, or binary language, that is provided to the hardware is converted by the assembler. The device outputs data in accordance with the pattern of the received binary digits.

From conception to product, the ASIC design flow is an iterative process that is not static for every design. The details of the flow may change depending on ECO’s, IP requirements, DFT insertion, and SDC constraints, however the base concepts still remain. The flow can be broken down into 11 steps:

Architectural Design – A system engineer will provide the VLSI engineer with specifications for the system that are determined through physical constraints. The VLSI engineer will be required to design a circuit that meets these constraints at a microarchitecture modeling level.

RTL Design/Behavioral Modeling – RTL design and behavioral modeling are performed with a hardware description language (HDL). EDA tools will use the HDL to perform mapping of higher-level components to the transistor level needed for physical implementation. HDL modeling is normally performed using either Verilog or VHDL. One of two design methods may be employed while creating the HDL of a microarchitecture:

a. RTL Design – Stands for Register Transfer Level. It provides an abstraction of the digital circuit using:

i. Combinational logic
ii. Registers
iii. Modules (IP’s or Soft Macros)
b. Behavioral Modeling – Allows the microarchitecture modeling to be performed with behavior-based modeling in HDL. This method bridges the gap between C and HDL allowing HDL design to be performed

RTL Verification - Behavioral verification of design

DFT Insertion - Design-for-Test Circuit Insertion

Logic Synthesis – Logic synthesis uses the RTL netlist to perform HDL technology mapping. The synthesis process is normally performed in two major steps:

GTECH Mapping – Consists of mapping the HDL netlist to generic gates what are used to perform logical optimization based on AIGERs and other topologies created from the generic mapped netlist.

Technology Mapping – Consists of mapping the post-optimized GTECH netlist to standard cells described in the PDK

Standard Cells – Standard cells are fixed height and a multiple of unit size width. This width is an integer multiple of the SITE size or the PR boundary. Each standard cell comes with SPICE, HDL, liberty, layout (detailed and abstract) files used by different tools at different stages in the RTL2GDS flow.

Post-Synthesis STA Analysis: Performs setup analysis on different path groups.

Floorplanning – Goal is to plan the silicon area and create a robust power distribution network (PDN) to power each of the individual components of the synthesized netlist. In addition, macro placement and blockages must be defined before placement occurs to ensure a legalized GDS file. In power planning we create the ring which is connected to the pads which brings power around the edges of the chip. We also include power straps to bring power to the middle of the chip using higher metal layers which reduces IR drop and electro-migration problem.

Placement – Place the standard cells on the floorplane rows, aligned with sites defined in the technology lef file. Placement is done in two steps: Global and Detailed. In Global placement tries to find optimal position for all cells but they may be overlapping and not aligned to rows, detailed placement takes the global placement and legalizes all of the placements trying to adhere to what the global placement wants.

CTS – Clock tree synteshsis is used to create the clock distribution network that is used to deliver the clock to all sequential elements. The main goal is to create a network with minimal skew across the chip. H-trees are a common network topology that is used to achieve this goal.

Routing – Implements the interconnect system between standard cells using the remaining available metal layers after CTS and PDN generation. The routing is performed on routing grids to ensure minimal DRC errors.

The Skywater 130nm PDK uses 6 metal layers to perform CTS, PDN generation, and interconnect routing.
